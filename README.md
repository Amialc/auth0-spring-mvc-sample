## Demonstrates using Auth0 with Java Spring to create a Secured MVC Web Application

This is a companion sample for the [Auth0 Spring MVC](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-spring-mvc) library.
Please refer to that library and documentation for further information specific to the library itself.

Allows you to use Auth0 with Java Spring for server-side MVC web apps. Leverages Spring Boot dependencies.
Validates the JWT from Auth0 in every API call to assert authentication according to configuration. If your application only needs secured
endpoints and the ability to programmatically work with a Principal object for GrantedAuthority checks this library is a good fit. However,
if you are already using Java Spring and wish to leverage fully Java Spring Security - with powerful support for Security Annotations, Security
JSTL Tag libraries, Fine-grained Annotation level method security and URL endpoint security at the Role / Group level - then see this project
[Auth0 Spring Security MVC](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-spring-security-mvc) and associated sample
[Auth0 Spring Security MVC Sample](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-spring-security-mvc-sample)

### Prerequisites

In order to run this example you will need to have Java 7+ and Maven installed.

Check that your maven version is 3.0.x or above:

```sh
mvn -v
```

This project relies upon `Spring Boot`.


Benefits of Spring Boot, in particular for traditional server-side web application / microservices architectures:

**Automatic configuration** - Spring Boot can automatically provide configuration for application functionality common to many Spring applications.

**Starter dependencies** - Tell Spring Boot what kind of functionality you need, and it will ensure that the libraries needed are added to the build.

**Command-line interface** - Optional feature of Spring Boot lets you write complete applications with just application code, but no need for a traditional
 project build.

**The Actuator** - Gives you insight into what's going on inside of a running Spring Boot application.


### Setup

Create an [Auth0 Account](https://auth0.com) (if not already done so - free!).


#### From the Auth0 Dashboard

Create an application - for the purposes of this sample - `app`

Ensure you add the following to the settings.

Allowed Callback URL:

```
http://localhost:3099/callback
```

Ensure you add the following to the settings.

Allowed Logout URLs:

```
http://localhost:3099/logout
```

Add one or more `connections` to your application - for instance Google Social Connection,
or username-password DB connection.


### Inside the Application - update configuration information

Enter your:

`client_id`, `client_secret`, and `domain` information into `src/main/resources/auth0.properties`


### Build and Run

In order to build and run the project execute:

```sh
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Then, go to [http://localhost:3099/login](http://localhost:3099/login).

Finally, in addition, using Spring Boot `actuator` we can easily verify various health and performance statistics for our running application.

Here are just a few of the available endpoints:

```
http://localhost:3099/metrics
http://localhost:3099/health
http://localhost:3099/mappings
http://localhost:3099/env
```
